# AnotherAgotino

This project is a rework of the [aGotino](https://github.com/mappite/aGotino) telescope mount firmware.
It only implements lx200 command set and supports slew and guide commands.
I use it with arduino nano every in combination with a TMC modded cnc shield v4. But the firmware can be easily adapted to other arduino stepper driver combination.
I also switched the project from arduino to platformio


Many thanks to mappite for the aGotino Project
